so in the end I said ok to Thomas to join their group.
had to make an account on their sort of blog
and post a little hello message to introduce myself.
was kinda awkward aha ^^'
didn’t put much effort into the password,
just did the same as all my other accounts lmao.
one thing Thomas didn’t tell me though
is that it’s originally a group of people
obsessed with robots or idk what.
some posts on the blog are kinda weird but
some others are actually interesting.
anyway, Thomas told me to read the blog rules
and stay active ‘cause apparently it’s frowned upon if you don’t
and they can kick you out of the community.
Pierre’s not really replying much lately
and doesn’t seem to find this friend group as cool as I do,
kinda makes me sad but oh well, not a big deal.
