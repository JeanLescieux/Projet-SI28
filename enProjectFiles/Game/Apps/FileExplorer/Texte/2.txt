went to see Loki at mom’s this week.
she’s still young but she’s already getting big, that dog.
every time I come back home I miss her though.
my dream would be to have a bigger apartment and a dog.
and a new PC. mine’s way too old
can barely run Eve Online.
at least since it was dad’s, I didn’t have to pay for it.
also I asked on a gaming forum if someone wanted to play Eve Online with me
and no one answered for a while, I was so sad lmao.
but then this guy replied like 5 days later,
I only know his username (kinda ridiculous btw ^^')
but he’s cool so we started playing and all.
he’s pretty good so the matches are interesting,
and outside of that we started talking,
makes time go by a little faster.
