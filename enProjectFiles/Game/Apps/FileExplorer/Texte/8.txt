just got back from their meeting.
I don’t really understand what I saw.
I don’t think I believe what I saw with my own eyes.
they were in a half-basement,
so I stood by the window where they couldn’t see me.
since it was nighttime, I could see everything inside.
there were three black boxes,
looked like polystyrene or something.
they sat there talking for like 20 minutes,
doing nothing.
I almost left.
then they opened one of the boxes.
inside, there were a bunch of plastic bags.
there was also a box full of tools,
like the kind for surgical operations,
and another one packed with tiny electronic components.
they moved closer to a table
and emptied the plastic bags.
there was an eye.
pieces of skin.
an arm.
blood everywhere.
I don’t know how long I stood there.
I felt sick and bolted to throw up.
I think I made noise when I left.
I don’t know if they heard me.
I don’t know what to do.
I really can’t tell my mom about this.
can’t tell anyone, actually.
no way I’m sleeping tonight.
