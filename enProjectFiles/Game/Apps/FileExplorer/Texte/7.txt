so actually, Thomas’s msn account has the same password.
I gotta admit, I was way too curious, so I checked.
not sure what I was expecting.
he had some conversations with unread messages,
but the weirdest thing was this group
called Digital Saviors or something like that.
there were people in there that I recognized,
the same ones who are super active in the group.
the discussions seemed really serious,
but I didn’t understand anything—
some sentences made no sense,
like they were using some kind of coded language.
the most recent messages were about a meeting
with an address not too far from me, next Saturday.
I don’t know what’s gotten into me, but I’m gonna go check it out.
I think I just really need to satisfy my curiosity.
