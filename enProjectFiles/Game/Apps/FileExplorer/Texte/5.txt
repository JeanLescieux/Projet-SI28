a few days ago I passed the test
to get into the private part of the group.
Thomas was the one who convinced me to do it,
he said it was more interesting than
just lurking around random forums.
the test was kinda hard, I think it took me at least 2 hours,
but when I passed it
a code popped up and I could access the chat.
there’s about 70 of us in there, and they don’t let just anyone in.
since Thomas seems to know a lot of the people running
the group, he put in a good word for me and everything,
that was nice of him.
people in the group are way more active than on the forum
so we game all night and chat pretty much non-stop.
I looked into what they talk about
and I actually find it super interesting.
since I’m bored it keeps me busy all day.
but honestly it’s bad, I’ve been eating only pasta
and I’m getting so sick of it
but I’m way too lazy to go out and buy anything else.
mom says I should come visit her
but I really don’t wanna take the train
and be stuck in a crowd right now,
it stresses me out.
Pierre’s still not really replying.
my stomach hurts.
