Thomas came over on Thursday.
basically, he got his pc hacked
by downloading a video from some shady site,
with all his data on it, and his pc
wouldn’t stay on for more than a few minutes.
he called me in a panic,
he was super stressed about his data
and asked if he could come over
since we don’t live that far apart,
just to log into his accounts
and change all his passwords.
I was kinda surprised he called me,
but I said yes, and he showed up 2 hours later.
he changed his passwords,
and then we went for a coffee at the café downstairs.
funny thing, I didn’t picture him looking like that.
when I got back to my room,
I noticed on my little stack of post-its
that there was a mark from when he wrote
his new password, which was literally just "pizza",
and you could still read what he wrote.
I got way too curious about
what his Eve Online account looked like,
so I tried logging in with the email
he uses for msn, and it worked.
haven’t told him yet,
not sure if I should confess to something like that.
honestly, I think I’ll just keep it to myself,
I didn’t hurt anyone.
