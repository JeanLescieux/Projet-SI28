the guy I met on the forum is called Thomas,
we talk every day so I ended up learning his name.
we also call on skype so he tells me about his life and stuff.
same as me, he’s got nothing to do this summer and he’s bored as hell.
he’s alone at home but he mentioned
an online friend group.
he asked me if I wanted to be part of it.
when I told mom about it she said to avoid it
‘cause you never really know people on the internet.
so when we called again
I told him I wasn’t really sure and he sounded kinda disappointed,
so I added that I’d think about it.
tbh I met Thomas online too
and he’s cool so I think it’s fine.
also Loki was sick and at the vet this week
so I couldn’t see her.
