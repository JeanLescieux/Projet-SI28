it's the start of summer vacation.
my exams went pretty well tbh,
but well every time it’s like I’m cursed or something,
so imma wait for the grades before telling mom -_-
i don’t like this time of year, every summer I get bored as hell
well usually I get bored with Pierre,
so when there’s two of us it’s less boring,
but now that he moved out
this is gonna be suuuuper long...
good thing the internet exists,
no clue how I’d manage otherwise
so I’m starting this journal,
usually I write in my notebooks
but now I’d rather write on my pc it's faster
i’d like to keep up a pace of 1 page per week,
that’ll help me not go crazy aha
