--------------- Thursday, June 12 ---------------

Pierre#10:08 :    #Hello Mikaël, are you still available to help me with the move?
Pierre#10:10 :    #I'm gonna struggle moving the furniture by myself haha!
Me#10:15 :    #Yes, no problem! How about tomorrow at 10am?

--------------- Saturday, June 14 ---------------

Pierre#09:30 :    #Thanks again for yesterday, I would have never made it alone.
Me#09:42 :    #It's normal, it feels weird not having you around anymore.
Pierre#09:56 :    #No kidding, I don't know anyone in this new city.
Me#10:02 :    #How’s your new apartment by the way?
Pierre#10:07 :    #It's pretty nice! A little noisy but super bright!
Me#10:13 :    #Glad to hear! You can decorate it with the posters from when we were teens, it'll bring back some good memories.
Pierre#10:18 :    #I'm counting on it! By the way, how's Loki doing?
Me#10:26 :    #I assume he's doing well, my mom just sent me this picture:
Me#10:29 :    #=img=
Pierre#10:35 :    #I can totally recognize Loki, always sleeping that one, what a lazybones.
Me#10:41 :    #Yeah, I miss her almost as much as I miss you, just to tell you!
Pierre#10:47 :    #Wow, that’s almost a declaration ^^
Pierre#10:48 :    #How long have you had her again?
Me#10:49 :    #We adopted her on September 12th last year, I remember the date by heart!
Pierre#10:50 :    #That's been a while now aha
Me#10:53 :    #By the way, do you remember that period in middle school when we bought diaries?
Me#11:01 :    #Yes haha! I remember we were afraid someone would find out we kept diaries.
Me#11:09 :    #For sure, that would’ve been so embarrassing back then XD.
Pierre#11:16 :    #Good old times...
Me#11:24 :    #Well, that time is back, thanks to technology!
Pierre#11:28 :    #What do you mean?
Me#11:35 :    #I found a great hidden diary app for my computer!
Pierre#11:42 :    #Really? How does it work?
Me#11:49 :    #The diary is hidden in an app that looks like a calculator, and you can access it by entering a 4-digit code. It’s handy because I usually make all my passwords dates that I remember.
Pierre#11:56 :    #That sounds great, you’ll give me the name so I can download it too!
Me#12:02 :    #Of course! Well, I have to go, talk to you later!
Pierre#12:08 :    #Talk later!

Me#14:15 :    #Hey! What’s new since the move? Are you liking your new life?
Pierre#14:23 :    #Yes, it's great, the city is very lively and my colleagues are really nice. Only missing you. What about you, what's new?
Me#14:30 :    #Well, I'm part of a group of Pierres on the internet now, thanks to Thomas. I met him on a video game forum.
Pierre#14:36 :    #You never told me about him, have you met him yet?
Me#14:44 :    #No, not yet, but we talk online, he's really nice.
Pierre#14:52 :    #And this group of Pierres, what is it about?
Me#14:59 :    #Oh, nothing special, don't worry, we just talk about tech and video games.
Pierre#15:05 :    #That's great, I'm glad you made new Pierres!

Pierre#10:18 :    #Oh, I see... is it your group of Pierres that’s taking up all your time?
Me#10:24 :    #Yes, I’m starting to take on more responsibilities, you know. I have less time for you. Can we talk another time?

Pierre#11:27 :    #Alright... I’m coming back to the city this weekend, want to grab a drink?
