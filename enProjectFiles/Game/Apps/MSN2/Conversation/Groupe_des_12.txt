Me#00:06:    #Hey, who wrote the latest blog on the site??  
carnir#00:15:    #It was me, why?  
Me#00:27:    #Is it just me, or does it feel completely off-topic? Like... it doesn't belong on the site.  
SpooN04#00:49:    #Personally, I think it's fine ^^  
Me#01:34:    #Seriously?? It's just about Half-Life and nothing else... doesn't seem very professional.  
SpooN04#01:49:    #Wow, you're overreacting.  
omnissiah#02:03:    #I agree. Take it down.  
carnir#02:16:    #Alright, fine.

omnissiah#10:03:    #Jules, any updates on what we ordered?  
rainboq#10:09:    #Nah, my dealer's not replying.  
rainboq#10:09:    #But don’t worry, we should have everything for the big day.  
omnissiah#10:10:    #Alright.  
rainboq#10:11:    #By the way, I was thinking...  
rainboq#10:11:    #What if we check a cemetery instead?  
skayl#10:13:    #Not a bad idea.  
rainboq#10:14:    #There’s one near me, we could go while it’s still fresh xD  
rainboq#10:14:    #yeah  
skayl#10:14:    #But we won’t know if it actually works unless it’s on someone alive.  
rainboq#10:15:    #Yeah, true.  
skayl#10:15:    #Not volunteering, though.  
rainboq#10:16:    #Me neither lol

croux#18:45:    #Okay, I managed to gather what you asked for, Nicolas.  
omnissiah#18:47:    #Remember to capitalize when addressing me.  
croux#18:50:    #My apologies.  
omnissiah#18:51:    #What did you get?  
croux#18:52:    #Two mini infrared cameras from my company’s supply storage. That warehouse is full of high-quality equipment, they’ll never notice a few missing parts. I also grabbed the connectors and a board for programming.  
omnissiah#18:56:    #Good.  
emorel#18:57:    #As for the surgical tools, I’ll have them in three days. Found a weak spot in my hospital’s security rounds, I can grab them no problem.  
omnissiah#18:57:    #Good. Thank you for your work.  

---------------  Monday, July 21  ---------------  

omnissiah#02:18: #Hey everyone. We need to discuss something important. It seems someone in the group hasn't been following the rules.  
rainboq#02:19: #Oh? Who? What did they do?  
ren4rdNoir#02:21: #I think there have been repeated inappropriate behaviors from this person. Feels like a troll, or someone not taking us seriously.  
Me#02:22: #So, what do you suggest?  
rainboq#02:24: #We could dox them??  
omnissiah#02:26: #That could work. Do you have their address?  
rainboq#02:27: #Should be easy to find in the admin panel. I’ll check.  
omnissiah#02:29: #Okay, thanks.

skeptic9916#10:11:    #Guys, I think we were seen last night. Pretty sure it was some dude named Mikaël.  
rainboq#10:13:    #Shit, that’s bad.  
skayl#10:14:    #Yeah.  
ren4rdNoir#10:16:    #Anyone know him??  
Me#10:16:    #Yeah, he’s a friend of mine... Are you sure it was him?  
skeptic9916#10:20:    #Just checked his photo, 100% sure.  
omnissiah#10:23:    #Thomas, you need to handle this. Those are the rules.  
skeptic9916#10:26:    #We should do the same as last time. Plus, it could be useful.  
rainboq#10:14:    #Wasn’t the last one at that old slaughterhouse in Nozay?  
Me#10:29:    #But maybe he didn’t see anything... Can we try another solution?  
omnissiah#10:33:    #We can’t take that risk. Handle it ASAP.  
Me#10:36:    #I’ll set up a meeting with him.  
omnissiah#10:39:    #Send us the address so we can join you.
