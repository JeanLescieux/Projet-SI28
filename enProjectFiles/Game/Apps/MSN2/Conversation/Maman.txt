Mom#18:25 :    #Good evening my son, how are you?
Me#18:35 :    #Eh, I'm bored since Pierre moved to Paris, I don't have much to do. And you, what's new? How’s Loki?
Mom#18:45 :    #Same old, your dad is working, Loki is sleeping... As usual ^^
Mom#18:46 :    #=img=
Me#18:48 :    #That's totally Loki!
Mom#18:50 :    #Do you have any plans tonight? It might change your mind to go out with friends...
Me#18:53 :    #Not really, it's hard to meet people when you don’t know anyone. I can’t see myself going to the bar alone.
Mom#18:59 :    #Well... It's up to you. I'm worried, you know, it’s not healthy to stay locked up all day, you should come by the house...
Me#19:02 :    #Don’t worry. And with dad, it's a bit complicated. I’m not sure he'd like having me underfoot. And besides, I'm not really alone, I met a friend online!
Mom#19:25 :    #Online? What's his name?
Me#19:26 :    #His name is Thomas, I met him on a video game forum.
Mom#19:28 :    #Well... be careful, you never really know who people are until you’ve met them. Your dad is waiting for me to sleep, good night my son.
Me#19:30 :    #Good night, mom.

Me#10:01 :    #Hey mom, do you remember my friend Thomas?
Me#10:03 :    #I think he’s really a good friend. We play and talk about video games, it feels good to meet new people.
Mom#10:26 :    #I’m happy for you my son, it’s a good thing.
Me#10:29 :    #He even offered me to join his online friend group. I think I'm going to say yes.
Mom#10:35 :    #An online friend group? What is it?
Me#10:45 :    #I’m not sure. Apparently, they like technology and want to use it to improve the human body, a real video game scenario!
Mom#10:50 :    #I’m not sure Mikaël, you don’t know these people, and all that technology stuff scares me, you should be careful...
Me#11:00 :    #Don’t worry mom, these people seem very nice. Anyway, I can't talk much about it, it's a top secret project.
Mom#11:25 :    #Alright, come by the house when you have time, we miss you.
Me#11:26 :    #I’ll come by next week, I promise.

Mom#17:21 :    #Good evening my son, I know you’re busy but you were supposed to come this week, and I haven’t seen you, is everything okay?
Mom#17:22 :    #Did something happen to you?
Me#17:25 :    #Everything’s fine, I'm really busy with my friend group, I’ll come by another time.
Mom#17:30 :    #Okay, but are you sure you're okay? You haven’t called me either...
Me#17:32 :    #I told you, I’m fine! I have a lot of work.
Mom#17:34 :    #I’m really worried Mikaël, your behavior has changed, I don’t think these friends are good for you...
Me#17:35 :    #I know what’s good for me.
