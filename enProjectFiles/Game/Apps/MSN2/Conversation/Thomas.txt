Thomas#14:41 : #Hi Mikaël, I’m the one who replied to your post about Eve Online on the forum! I'm also a big fan of video games, would you like to play together sometime? I’ve got nothing to do this summer haha.
Me#15:15 : #Great, I honestly didn’t think anyone would reply to my message, nice to meet you then ^^
Thomas#15:20 : #How long have you been playing video games?
Me#15:23 : #Since middle school, we played a lot with my childhood friend, but he moved not long ago :(
Thomas#15:25 : #That’s why you’re looking for gaming buddies on the internet?
Me#15:30 : #Yes, partly, I’m pretty shy so it’s easier to meet people behind a screen, plus I don’t really like going out haha.
Thomas#15:31 : #I see... well, what are we waiting for, add me on the game! My email is: thomas@mail.com

--------------- Monday, July 7 ---------------

Me#11:12 : #That was fun yesterday, we need to do that again!
Thomas#16:25 : #Yes, definitely, we had a good time, how about a game every 2 days at 4 PM?
Me#16:25 : #Yes, totally!
Thomas#16:26 : #You know, I thought about what you told me yesterday.
Me#16:35 : #About what?
Thomas#16:36 : #About you saying you're shy and don’t have many friends, and I’ve got an idea for you.
Me#16:37 : #Oh, what’s this idea?
Thomas#16:38 : #I’m part of an online group of friends, we discuss technology, it’s super interesting and I’m sure they’d love you!
Me#16:39 : #An online group of friends? Do you guys play video games together?
Thomas#16:42 : #Even better!
Thomas#16:43 : #We’re developing technological tools for digital immortality, pretty cool, huh?
Me#16:45 : #Wow, I’ve never heard of that, what does it involve?
Thomas#16:50 : #Well, the idea is that human bodies are imperfect because they’re mortal, and we’re working on technologies to overcome mortality, imagine the potential this could have?
Thomas#16:53 : #I know it’s a bit vague but it’s a pretty... confidential project so I can’t tell you more until you’re part of the group...
Me#17:12 : #So how do I become part of this group?
Thomas#17:16 : #Oh, you’re interested? That’s awesome, I’ll add you to the blog, you can read more for yourself!
Thomas#17:18 : #Here’s the link: http://digital-saviors.org, you’ll see there’s a small financial contribution but it’s for funding the research, you understand?
Me#17:23 : #Thanks a lot, I’ll check it out. Want to play a game tonight?
Thomas#17:23 : #Sure!

--------------- Wednesday, July 9 ---------------

Me#14:14 : #Hello, free?
Thomas#14:16 : #Yes, let’s go!

--------------- Friday, July 11 ---------------

Thomas#14:14 : #Hey, want to play?
Me#14:16 : #Yes, two minutes!

--------------- Sunday, July 13 ---------------

Thomas#16:00 : #So, what do you think of the blog?
Me#16:06 : #I find it really interesting, I learned a lot, but I’m not sure I want to join, I don’t know much about this kind of technology... and my mom told me to be careful with people on the internet.
Thomas#16:10 : #You don’t need to know much, we’ll teach you everything we know! And think about the amazing opportunity it is!
Me#16:14 : #I’m not sure what I have to gain, to be honest...
Thomas#16:16 : #You have so much to gain, knowledge, and you’ll be one of the first to have access to immortality if you decide to join, you’re really going to miss one of humanity’s greatest revolutions??
Me#16:17 : #I don’t know...
Thomas#16:19 : #It won’t take much of your time, plus you’ll be able to make decisions, it’s super cool, right? I’ll be really disappointed if you don’t join...
Me#16:20 : #Alright, I’ll give it a try then. I’ll think about it.
Thomas#16:22 : #Great, there’s just a little entrance test, just a formality, it’s mainly to check that your intentions are good, but I don’t doubt that. You’ll get an email from another member for the test.
Me#16:22 : #Got it, I’ll keep you posted.

--------------- Monday, July 14 ---------------

Me#14:41 : #Thomas, guess what, I passed the test, I’m now a member of the group!
Thomas#14:51 : #Awesome, that’s great news, now I’ve got a few things to explain to you.
Me#14:53 : #I’m listening.
Thomas#14:56 : #Well, you need to know that now you’re a member, for confidentiality reasons, we’re not allowed to communicate in private messages, we still do, but you’ll need to be discreet about it.
Me#15:01 : #Got it, I won’t talk about it.
Thomas#15:25 : #You must also avoid communicating with people outside the group, even your family, I know it’s a bit restrictive but we can’t risk confidential information leaking.
Me#15:10 : #Oh, so I can’t talk to my mom or my best friend?
Thomas#15:12 : #You should avoid it as much as possible, don’t worry, it’s only for a while, until the technology is finished. You can talk to me, I’m your friend, it’s just for a little while.
Me#15:12 : #Alright...
Thomas#15:15 : #Another tip, don’t debate too much with the boss, Nicolas, he doesn’t really like that XDD, and make sure to read the group rules, otherwise they can kick you out...
Me#15:16 : #Got it.

--------------- Wednesday, July 16 ---------------

Thomas#14:14 : #Hello, free for a call?
Me#14:16 : #Yes, let’s go!

--------------- Friday, July 18 ---------------

Thomas#14:14 : #Hello, free?

--------------- Tuesday, July 29 ---------------

Thomas#14:14 : #I’ve seen you’re getting involved more and more in the group activities, I’m happy you’re enjoying it, it’s so cool right ^^
Me#14:16 : #Yes, a lot, the project is fascinating, I spend almost all my days on it.

--------------- Friday, August 1 ---------------

Thomas#14:14 : #Thanks for yesterday, it really saved my life to be able to change my passwords, I don’t think much was affected.
Me#14:16 : #No worries, glad I could help! It was nice going for coffee after with you, I don’t go out much these days haha.

--------------- Friday, August 15 ---------------

Thomas#17:17 : #I noticed you’ve been participating less in the group activities, is everything okay Mikaël?
Me#17:29 : #Yes, yes, I’ve got some outside issues.
Thomas#17:30 : #You know the outside world is corrupt, you shouldn’t worry about those things, what matters most is the group, and me...
Me#17:56 : #I know... I’ll get back to work quickly, I promise.
Thomas#17:57 : #Good, let’s meet on Sunday for a coffee to discuss a new project, it’s pretty important.
Me#18:45 : #Alright, where and when?
Thomas#18:45 : #Same place as last time? 4 PM?
Me#18:45 : #Okay, I’ll be there.
