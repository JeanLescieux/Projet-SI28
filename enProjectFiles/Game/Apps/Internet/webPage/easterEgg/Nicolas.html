    <h2>Patient Report No. 67</h2>

    <h3>Patient Identity:</h3>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Nicolas Lamarque <br>
        <strong>Age:</strong> 25 years <br>
        <strong>Gender:</strong> Male
    </p>

    <h3>Medical History:</h3>
    <p>The patient has a complex background, marked by early involvement in a potentially sectarian religious group, where he was exposed to manipulation techniques and a worldview filled with distrust and pessimism. Additionally, he suffers from a physical disability that has limited his mobility, leading to a form of isolation, spending long periods bedridden or in the hospital.</p>

    <h3>Hobbies and Interests:</h3>
    <p>The patient has developed a marked interest in video games, particularly titles such as Deus Ex, Quake II, and Half-Life, as well as in Warhammer 40k figurine games. His immersion in these fictional universes has fueled a fascination with the digital world, cyborgs, and transhumanism, themes that resonate with his own reduced physical condition.</p>

    <h3>Online Behavior:</h3>
    <p>Under the pseudonym @Omnissiah, the patient has established a significant online presence by creating a forum/blog dedicated to transhumanism and the digital revolution. His goal is to raise awareness of the injustice of human physical limitations and promote the transfer of consciousness into machines. He has used targeted recruitment strategies, exploiting the emotional vulnerability of individuals and encouraging them to join his community to fulfill a need for connection and belonging.</p>

    <h3>Social Behavior:</h3>
    <p>The patient has shown manipulative tendencies, offering privileges and responsibilities within his community to encourage loyalty and dependence. He has also used his status as a moderator to exert influence and silence any opposition to his ideas or actions.</p>

    <h3>Secrets and Dark Projects:</h3>
    <p>The patient actively conceals his physical disability and maintains a distorted image of himself online. Additionally, he is involved in clandestine activities, including animal medical experiments and projects aimed at achieving bionic enhancements and consciousness transfers. These activities are kept secret within his community, with pressure to maintain confidentiality and a fear of exposure to the police.</p>

    <h3>Diagnosis:</h3>
    <p>The patient exhibits narcissistic and manipulative personality traits, combined with a sense of grandeur and an obsessive need for control. His immersion in virtual worlds and his quest for physical and mental transcendence reveal a compulsive need to escape his physical reality and compensate for his own limitations.</p>

    <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
    <p>Immediate intervention is crucial to prevent any illicit activity and protect the safety and well-being of individuals involved in the patient's online community. Specialized therapy focused on managing manipulation and antisocial behaviors is recommended, as well as close monitoring to prevent further potentially dangerous actions.</p>
