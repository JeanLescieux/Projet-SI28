    <h2>The Twelve Apostles</h2>
    <p>The <strong>twelve Apostles</strong>, or, by ellipsis, <strong>The Twelve</strong>, or simply the <strong>Apostles</strong>, are the twelve disciples chosen by Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, according to Christian tradition, Jesus also distinguished seventy disciples, who later became bishops of a city. All these disciples preached the "good news," a phrase that gave birth to the word "gospel" after the texts were written in the years 65-100.</p>
    <p>Paul of Tarsus is considered the "thirteenth apostle" by Christian tradition: he is called the "Apostle of the Gentiles."</p>
    <p>Catholics and Orthodox Christians consider bishops to be the successors of the Apostles and place special importance on the fact that bishops are in the apostolic succession, meaning that the tradition to which they belong traces back to the apostles in the succession of people and doctrines.</p>
