                    <h4>How to Be Immortal</h4>
                    <section>
                        <h5><span class="highlight">Digital Immortality</span></h5>
                        <p>
                            But first, let's define the term "<span class="highlight">digital immortality</span>" as "the continuation of an active or passive digital presence after death."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the first, if not the very first, articles describing "<span class="highlight">digital immortality</span>" dates back to 2000. In an article titled <em>Digital Immortality</em>, Gordon Bell and Jim Gray speculated that in the future, it will be possible to create a "<span class="highlight">two-way immortality</span>" where an individual's experiences and learnings would continue to evolve in a digital form after their death. <span class="highlight">Digital immortality</span> involves converting aspects of a person into information and storing it on a durable medium. The authors anticipate that it will be possible to create avatars or digital versions of individuals who can interact with others, learn, and stay updated with advancements, thus leading to a form of <span class="highlight">two-way immortality</span>. This could mean that a digital representation of a person could continue to "live and communicate" indefinitely.

                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h5><span class="highlight">One-Way and Two-Way Immortality</span></h5>
                        <p>
                            One of the key concepts in exploring <span class="highlight">digital immortality</span> is the concept of <span class="highlight">one-way and two-way immortality</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "<span class="highlight">One-way immortality</span>" refers to a form of <span class="highlight">digital immortality</span> where a person's data, such as their thoughts, memories, and personality, is preserved in a digital form, but there is no ongoing interaction with the outside world. In this model, the digital persona is not designed to learn, adapt, or evolve in response to new interactions after its initial creation. It is a static preservation, similar to a time capsule of a person's digital footprint, existing without the capacity for growth or change. An example of this could be a person's Instagram profile or any other social media profile. It contains information about that person, what they liked, what they created, or their opinions on various topics, but it will not change. It is static, frozen in time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "<span class="highlight">Two-way immortality</span>", on the other hand, involves a dynamic form of <span class="highlight">digital immortality</span> where the digital persona can interact with the living, learn from new experiences, and perhaps even evolve over time. This model suggests a more sophisticated form of digital existence where the persona can engage in interactive relationships with the environment and the people around it, much like a living being. This type of <span class="highlight">immortality</span> is more complex and raises additional questions about consciousness, identity, and the nature of existence, as the digital persona is not merely a record, but an active participant that can evolve independently from its original human model. This is where human chatbot replicas come into play.
